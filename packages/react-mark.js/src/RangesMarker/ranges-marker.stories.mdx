# ⚡️ `<RangesMarker />`
Sometimes you may want to mark text-content based on the
position in the text content instead of a string.  For ex.
you would like to mark text between the 5th and 8th 
characted of a text string.  

export const args = {
  mark: [
    {
      start: 3,
      length: 4,
    },
  ],
  children: <h1>0123456789</h1>,
};

## ‣ Basic Example
In this example, we mark 4 letters starting 
from the 3rd letters.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="String121212" args={{
        ...args,
        mark: [
            {
            start: 3,
            length: 4,
            },
        ]
    }}>
        {args => <RangesMarker {...args} />}
    </Story>
</Canvas>


## ‣ Multiple Ranges Example
In this example, we mark 5 letters starting 
from the 3rd letters and 15 letters starting 
from the 10th letter

<Canvas>
    <Story name="String1212123" args={{
        ...args,
        mark: [
            {
            start: 3,
            length: 5,
            },
            {
            start: 20,
            length: 15,
            },
        ],
        children: [
            <h1>
                0123456789<br />
                0123456789<br />
                0123456789<br />
                0123456789<br />
                0123456789<br />
            </h1>
        ]
    }}>
        {args => <RangesMarker {...args} />}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
